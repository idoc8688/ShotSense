2. Start the application
3. Player needs to get into initial position (marked position on the court, hold the ball with ball with both hands down)
4. Second user enters the 's' character, to indicate that the player is about to shoot the ball
5. Then the player shoots the ball
6. Second user enters the 'e' character to indicate that the player finished shooting
7. Second user tags the last shot result as 'h' (hit) or 'm' (miss)
8. A new .csv file is created represeting the last shot data, located in a directory named with the current date
